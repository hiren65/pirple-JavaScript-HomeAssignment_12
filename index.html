                <span>What Is OOP Programming?</span><br>
                Historically, a program has been viewed as a logical procedure that takes input data,
                processes it, and produces output data.
                As for example suppose we have to store 5 peoples personal details in programme.
                it can be used to do,
                <pre class="code">
                var name1 = "richard"

                var address1 = "29 morgan street parkVille 2345"

                var gender1 = male
                </pre>
                Likewise you have to mess with repetitive data assignment
                and Also, the separation of data from method prevents a common
                problem found in older linear software languages.
                If a bug appears in a linear code, it can be translated through
                a system and create masses of hard-to-trace errors. Conversely,
                an OOP program, with its separation of method and data, is not
                susceptible to such proliferated errors.
                One of the great benefits of OOP is that of scalability,
                with objects and definitions having no finite limitation.
                <h2>Defination:</h2>
                It's kind of structure or can say template object that can be
                used for many time so through it you can do to manipulate data,
                help store data, retrieve and help to view data through MVC
                model.It's collection of method and variables. It is a blueprint
                that defines the data and behavior of a type.<br>
                <span> why would you use it?</span><br>

                many javascript projects are written using a functional,
                or event-driven design pattern. <br>
                <span> In which cases would an OOP pattern be a better choice?</span><br><br>

                Object Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to using
                self-contained pieces of code to develop applications. We call
                these self-contained pieces of code objects, better known as
                Classes in most OOP programming languages and Functions in
                JavaScript. We use objects as building blocks for our
                applications. Building applications with objects allows us to
                adopt some valuable techniques, namely, Inheritance
                (objects can inherit features from other objects),
                Polymorphism (objects can share the same interface—how they
                are accessed and used—while their underlying implementation
                of the interface may differ), and Encapsulation (each object
                is responsible for specific tasks).
                In JavaScript, objects can encapsulate functionality and
                inherit methods and properties from other objects, so

                <h2>Object Oriented Programming + Event-Driven Programming</h2>

                The last thing I want to touch on here is the combination of
                the Object Oriented and Event-driven programming paradigms.
                These two make for a very valuable combination in a wide
                variety of situations and I think it can be beneficial to
                understand and conceptualize why.

                The Object Oriented approach promotes the idea that all
                behavior of an individual unit (or object) be handled from
                code within that unit. Using this approach, applications are
                built with many different units that all speak to and interact
                with each other.

            <h2 id="const">The Constructor</h2>
            <div class="encloser01">
                The constructor is called at the moment of instantiation (the moment when the object instance is created).
                The constructor is a method of the class. In JavaScript, the function serves as the constructor of the object;
                therefore, there is no need to explicitly define a constructor method. Every action declared in the
                class gets executed at the time of instantiation.
                The constructor is used to set the object’s properties or to call methods to prepare the object for use.

                    function Mammal(name,lifeSpan,diet) {
                    this.name = name;
                    this.lifeSpan = lifeSpan;
                    this.diet = diet;
                    this.voice = function () {
                           console.log(`Mammal ${this.name} can make voice !!`);
                            };

                <h2 id="inh">Inheritance</h2>
                <div class="encloser01">
                    Inheritance is a way to create a class as a specialized version of one or more classes (
                    JavaScript only supports single class inheritance). The specialized class is commonly called the child,
                    and the other class is commonly called the parent. In JavaScript you do this by assigning an instance of
                    the parent class to the child class, and then specializing it.
                    Note: JavaScript does not detect the child class prototype.constructor see Object:prototype property,
                    so we must state that manually.

                <pre class="code">

                    It's life span ${dog.lifeSpan} years \n It is ${dog.diet}`);

                    function Man(name,lifeSpan,diet, isIntaligennt){
                        Mammal.call(this,name,lifeSpan,diet);
                        this.isteligent = isIntaligennt;
                    }

                <div class="encloser01" id="pro">
                    <span>Prototype-based programming</span><br>
                    Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which classes are not present,
                    and behavior reuse (known as inheritance in class-based languages) is accomplished through a process of
                    decorating existing objects which serve as prototypes.
                    This model is also known as class-less, prototype-oriented, or instance-based programming.
                    The original (and most canonical) example of a prototype-based language is the programming language Self
                    developed by David Ungar and Randall Smith. However, the class-less programming style has recently grown
                    increasingly popular, and has been adopted for programming languages such as JavaScript, Cecil,
                    NewtonScript, Io, MOO, REBOL, Kevo, Squeak (when using the Viewer framework to manipulate Morphic
                    components), and several others.1
                </div>
                <pre class="code">
                    //you can add properties and methods later in main Object
                    Mammal.prototype.habitat = "everywhere";
                    //now check in dog object, it's habitat
                    console.log(dog.habitat);
                    // now change, later added property in Mammal and inherited in
                    dog object
                    dog.habitat = "Around human Habitat";

                    console.log(dog.habitat);
                    // Same way you can add in Mammal object a new method
                    Mammal.prototype.swim = function () {
                      console.log(`${this.name} can swim!!`);
                    };
                    dog.swim();
                </pre>
                <h2 id="enc">Encapsulation</h2>
                <div class="encloser01" >
                    In the previous example, dog does not need to know how the Mammal class’s voice() method is
                    implemented, but still can use that method; the dog class doesn’t need to explicitly define
                    that method unless we want to change it. This is called encapsulation, by which every class inherits
                    the methods of its parent and only needs to define things it wishes to change.
                    Notes
                    The techniques presented in this article to implement object-oriented programming are not the only
                    ones that can be used in JavaScript, which is very flexible in terms of how object-oriented programming
                    can be performed.
                    Similarly, the techniques shown here do not use any language hacks,
                    nor do they mimic other languages’ object theory implementations.
