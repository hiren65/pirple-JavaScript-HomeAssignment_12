1. What Is **OOP** Programming?

Earlier before at the beginning pure logic was used in
software development in procedural programing. 
As for example suppose we have to store 5 peoples personal
details in programme.

it can be used to do, 

`var name1 = "richard"`

`var address1 = "29 morgan street parkVille 2345"`

`var gender1 = male` 

Likewise you have to mess with repetitive data assignment 
and Also, the separation of data from method prevents a common 
problem found in older linear software languages. 
If a bug appears in a linear code, it can be translated through
a system and create masses of hard-to-trace errors. Conversely,
an OOP program, with its separation of method and data, is not
susceptible to such proliferated errors.
One of the great benefits of OOP is that of scalability, 
with objects and definitions having no finite limitation.

### Defination:
It's kind of structure or can say template object that can be 
used for many time so through it you can do to manipulate data,
help store data, retrieve and help to view data through MVC
model.It's collection of method and variables. It is a blueprint 
that defines the data and behavior of a type.

2.**why would you use it?**

3.**many javascript projects are written using a functional, 
or event-driven design pattern. In which cases would an OOP
pattern be a better choice?** 

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to using 
self-contained pieces of code to develop applications. We call 
these self-contained pieces of code objects, better known as 
Classes in most OOP programming languages and Functions in 
JavaScript. We use objects as building blocks for our 
applications. Building applications with objects allows us to 
adopt some valuable techniques, namely, Inheritance 
(objects can inherit features from other objects), 
Polymorphism (objects can share the same interface—how they 
are accessed and used—while their underlying implementation 
of the interface may differ), and Encapsulation (each object 
is responsible for specific tasks).
In JavaScript, objects can encapsulate functionality and 
inherit methods and properties from other objects, so 

##### Object Oriented Programming + Event-Driven Programming

The last thing I want to touch on here is the combination of 
the Object Oriented and Event-driven programming paradigms. 
These two make for a very valuable combination in a wide 
variety of situations and I think it can be beneficial to 
understand and conceptualize why.

The Object Oriented approach promotes the idea that all 
behavior of an individual unit (or object) be handled from 
code within that unit. Using this approach, applications are 
built with many different units that all speak to and interact 
with each other.
